# Flood Prediction in Da Nang City ðŸŒŠ

Welcome to the **Flood Prediction in Da Nang City** project repository. This project aims to leverage data science to predict potential flood risks in Da Nang City, Vietnam. The primary goal is to build a predictive model that can provide early warnings and help local authorities and citizens take necessary actions to mitigate flood damage.

## Overview

Flooding has become an increasingly common issue in Da Nang City due to climate change and urban development. This project addresses this problem by developing a flood prediction model based on meteorological data, hydrological data, and geographical information. The model utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to predict flood events and improve disaster preparedness.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection**: Collection of rainfall, and weather data from reliable sources.
- **Data Processing**: Cleaning, normalizing, and feature engineering of the raw data to prepare for modeling.
- **Visualization**: Visual representation of flood predictions on a map of Da Nang City.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Datasets

- **Meteorological Data**: Rainfall.

## Requirements

To run this project locally, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.8+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
